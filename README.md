# Project : SuperHeroHunters

# About project:

This is basically the project where we can search for our favourite superhero and that we are fetching it from the given API structure in the document and we are displaying various things
regarding the searched superhero also we can add the superhero in our favourite list and we can remove the superhero from the favourite list. We have to fetch the superhero from 
api for that we have an API key which will get from the marvel developers account after signing in then we have to create the hash by installing crypto-js package so we can have
md5(ts+private_key+public_key) or the alternative to create hash by using online hash generator from the internet.
